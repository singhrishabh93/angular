# TypeScript Setup for Cofactr Dashboard

This project has been converted from JavaScript to TypeScript. Here's how to work with it:

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Development Workflow

### Option 1: Direct TypeScript Development (Recommended)

1. Edit the `.ts` files directly
2. Compile TypeScript to JavaScript:
```bash
npm run build
```
3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

### Option 2: Webpack Development Server

For a more modern development experience with hot reloading:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## File Structure

- **Source TypeScript files**: All `.ts` files in the project
- **Compiled JavaScript files**: Generated `.js` files (same locations as `.ts` files)
- **Type definitions**: `types.ts` contains all interface definitions
- **Configuration**: `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript compiler settings

## Key Features Added

1. **Type Safety**: All variables, functions, and objects now have proper TypeScript types
2. **Interface Definitions**: Comprehensive type definitions in `types.ts`
3. **Better IDE Support**: Enhanced autocomplete and error detection
4. **Compilation**: TypeScript files are compiled to JavaScript for browser compatibility

## Type Definitions

The `types.ts` file contains interfaces for:
- User management
- Product catalog
- Order processing
- Dashboard metrics
- Reports and analytics
- Support tickets
- And more...

## Compilation Process

The build process:
1. Compiles all `.ts` files to JavaScript
2. Copies compiled `.js` files to their original locations
3. Maintains the same file structure for easy deployment

## Development Tips

1. Always run `npm run build` after making changes to TypeScript files
2. Use the type definitions in `types.ts` for better code completion
3. The compiled JavaScript files are what the browser actually runs
4. Keep the original `.js` files in version control for deployment

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Make sure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
2. Check that TypeScript compilation succeeds: `npm run compile`
3. Verify that compiled `.js` files exist in the correct locations
4. Ensure the HTML file references the `.js` files, not `.ts` files
